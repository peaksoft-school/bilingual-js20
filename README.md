# 🎓 School Project — Bilingual (Vite + React + JavaScript)

This is an educational project developed as part of a course. The main focus is practicing modern React development using JavaScript, Redux Toolkit, MUI (Material UI), and clean component architecture.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** + JavaScript — main UI library
- **Vite** — fast build tool and development server
- **Redux Toolkit** — global state management & API logic
- **React Router v6** — routing
- **MUI (Material UI)** — modern and customizable UI components
- **Architecture**: Component-Based + Modular Folder Structure

## 🌿 Git Branching Convention

To maintain clean structure and teamwork efficiency, use the following branch naming rules:

| Branch Type | Purpose                     | Example                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feature/`  | New feature                 | `feature/add-auth-page`  |
| `bugfix/`   | Bug fixes                   | `bugfix/fix-mobile-menu` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring            | `refactor/clean-header`  |
| `docs/`     | Documentation updates       | `docs/readme-update`     |
| `test/`     | Adding or updating tests    | `test/add-auth-tests`    |
| `release/`  | Preparing a release version | `release/v1.0.0`         |

> ✅ Use `kebab-case` and English descriptions.

## Style Guide

#### Linters

We are using ESLint and Prettier to find bugs and errors before they happen. We'll spend less time testing new features and the team's code will be more consistent. We are following the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/songhee24/VS-CODE__ReactJs-with-ESLint-Prettier-and-Airbnb).
